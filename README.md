ðŸŽ¯ **Aspiring UI/UX Designer & Project Manager** 

Passionate about creating intuitive, user-centered designs and managing projects with precision and creativity.  
I aim to bridge the gap between design and execution, delivering solutions that delight users and achieve business goals.

  <summary> More About Me ðŸ’« </summary>

  I served as Project Manager and UX/UI Designer for various school activities, focusing on organizing tasks and creating user-friendly designs. I also took part in the IRCITE conference. Additionally, I competed in an IT Marketing Competition held within our school at La Verdad Christian College, where we placed 1st. These experiences helped me grow both personally and professionally.
